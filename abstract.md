# ABSTRACT

The social media platforms that we use now have some issues and problems with keeping user data private and with moderating fake news or inappropriate content without turning to censorship. The inappropriate content presents a risk for advertisers who can see their brand possibly compromised and the censorship discourages creative work. The manual moderation is not giving better results. The lack of transparency is also obvious, as social media platforms do not reveal how they use personal data, distribute content or share revenue.

The majority of social media platforms donâ€™t share revenues with content creators and the few that do so have monetization targets that are hard to attain. The average user is not compensated for being the target of lots of advertisements and these are not customized for individual preferences.

#### **Solutions we propose**

We introduced the VLOKR platform with the purpose of addressing the above issues. This is accomplished through the following:

* Promoting trust with a decentralized infrastructure that is transparent, open source and that does not give away personal information for advertising.
* A fairer and more accurate moderation that is done by the community through voting and tags without political and company intervention and censorship.
* A token model that rewards all participants such as creators, influencers and viewers for contributions to the platform.

#### **The tokens**

The platform has two tokens: VTV and VP. VTV is a cryptocurrency token that can influence how content is ranked on the platform. The content creators are rewarded with this token that will incentivize them to do a good job and adhere to community standards.

The VP token represents voting power that is accumulated by VTV holders. The holder will receive 1 VP hourly per VTV in account. A user needs VP to post, vote, tag and comment. The user will then be rewarded by the blockchain algorithm in VTV for posting quality content or for voting trending subjects.
