# III.4. The economic cycle

The circulating supply will be kept at a stable level to prevent inflationary concerns. It will be issued for rewarding users who post, vote or tag content and reduced through burning by advertisers. This allows the circulating supply to have a predictable nature.

The market capitalization will fluctuate because of the circulating supply and price also. The buying and selling of traders will influence where the price settles. The price is expected to have a high volatility similarly to other cryptocurrencies as this is a new sector with potential, opportunities and advancements.
