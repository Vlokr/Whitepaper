# APPENDIX C: COMPETITION

We are not the only company that activates in this sector because we know that a lot of alternative video platforms are planning to launch soon. We have some advantage over them because we already have a live product and we are not only a desktop application as we have support for mobiles also.

_Figure 11_: The new social platforms

We have a decentralized video infrastructure and increased user control. The files are not hosted on a centralized platform and distributed to users because this creates low performance and censorship issues. The video hosting and delivery infrastructure that we have uses the IPFS protocol and network. The content that is uploaded on the network is sent to all devices connected to the network so there is no central host. The network can redirect the stream to another host if a file is lost or removed. This means that the network is fast and the files are accessible to all.

The content is not controlled by a central authority and there is no unjust censorship. The network uses considerably less bandwidth and has almost no operating cost. This is because the users share the task of hosting the files as opposed to needing a central server. This also addresses poor performance issues when many users try to view the same content.

This new architecture is the reason of the improved performance of our video sharing platform. The monetization of user contributions such as voting, posting or tagging is also a significant feature of this platform that is likely to have a good reception. Such considerations are the reason why our product is an improvement compared to other platforms.
