# IV.1. The VLOKR organization

The creation of the VLOKR platform is the combined effort of a team of twenty or more software architects, university professors and students, software engineers, coders, cryptocurrency traders, as well as legal and corporate advisors. The team is divided between three corporations, tasked with building the software for applications.

The three corporations are:

#### 1) VLOKR Inc. in California, USA.

#### 2) 041 Agency in California, USA is the developer that works to create the VLOKR platform.

#### 3) The VLOCITY Foundation in Aruba, South America is a non-profit organization.

The native unit of exchange for all VLOKR applications is VTV. The VTV tokens will be assigned by rewarding all those working on creating Apps for the VLOKR platform. This will support the mass adoption of the VLOKR project in general and increase the value of VTV for its holders in particular.

A total of 2.1 billion tokens will be issued and distributed over the next 20 years as follows. The initial 1.3 billion are allocated in the coming 4 to 8 years period, then the remaining 800 million is assigned for the next 8 to 20 years period.

The initial 5% of the first 1.3 billion VTV will go to private funding where the early comers will be able to obtain the most benefits. The tokens will be available for all to purchase at the crowd sale or ICO.

The cryptocurrency industry has a high volatility of price and this will apply to our case also. The token value from private funding, its value at the crowd sale and the resulting market value after that will all be different and hopefully increasing if the plan is followed and the team does things the way they are supposed to.
